# Times Tables Quiz App with Google Sheets

The application in this repository is a times tables quiz that is [deployed here](https://if-combined-quiz-json-jgiwxdpztjmpvfnakvakh7.streamlit.app/) on Steamlit Community Cloud. The quiz randomly generates multiplication questions for users.

User results are stored in a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Nre44JhGSnAGPaBKMPUw9_9jKS7jcc8ivt4Xt8AujH0), where anyone can view the quiz outcomes.

## How it works

The app has three screens, each implemented in its own module:

- Welcome screen
- Quiz screen
- End screen
